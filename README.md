This OpenSSL repository is unmaintained
=======================================

Android no longer uses OpenSSL and instead has moved to BoringSSL. As a result
this repository is unmaintained and unused. It should not be used.

Most applications can move to using BoringSSL as well as long as it is not
making use of deprecated APIs. Please see these locations for more
information:

  * [BoringSSL repository](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/): The
    official BoringSSL repository.
  * [Android's BoringSSL project](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/boringssl/):
    Android's copy of BoringSSL.
