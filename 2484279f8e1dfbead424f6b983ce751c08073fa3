      "message": "what are your long-term plans for the command-line boringssl tool?\n\nmy specific interest is in the md*sum(1) and sha*sum(1) family. toybox currently has its own implementation of a subset of these hashes. i have a patch (for us; upstream doesn\u0027t want the extra library dependency) that just uses openssl (and implements the full coreutils set since you\u0027ve already done the hard work for me).\n\nbut if i could just symlink to boringssl and have it look at argv[0] i could get out of the business completely.",

      "message": "Internally I think openssl(1) is used quite a lot so this will probably grow to contain a fairly complete implementation of the common openssl(1) options.\n\nAdding support for the *sum functions, and for triggering based on argv[0] is no problem. I\u0027ll see about doing that tomorrow.\n\n(Although first I\u0027ll have to see whether the tool builds on Android. I don\u0027t have it building in the .mk file because I didn\u0027t expect to need it, and it uses C++11 featuresâ€”the status of which I\u0027ve not tested in Android.)",
