      "message": "I specifically put this on the build-tools branch so that the default branch still had this message. That branch is only part of the build-tools manifest, where we\u0027re already building python prebuilts for the host.\n\nFor some use cases (embedded_launcher) we\u0027re currently building the python interpreter for the host on master in addition to build-tools, but I\u0027m planning on making master use a prebuilt for that instead. An alternative if that falls through is to make the ssl support in python configurable based on the branch, but that seems too confusing for users.",
